small-real-time-kernel
======================

ultra-small, efficient, pre-emptive, fixed-priority, real-time kernel for a small machine, example given for the 6800

Many embedded systems can benefit from using a fixed-priority pre-emptive multitasking organization. 
This is particularly helpful in ensuring that subsystems that require regular updates keep on schedule.

This particular example was first disclosed in a letter to Dr. Dobb's Journal, Number 63, January, 1982, pp 6-8.
It shows a Multi-Tasking Kernel for a Motorola 6800 Microprocessor.
This design has been run in a number of products, with versions writen for various microprocessors, 
including the 8080, 8085, and 8086. The 8086 version ran MS-DOS as one thread in an embedded application.
